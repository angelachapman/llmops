This can include operations like variable substitution, conditionals, and other logical constructs that allow the behavior of language model interactions to be customized based on input or context.\\n\\nKey features of LECL may include:\\n\\n1. **Expressions**: The ability to define and evaluate expressions that can incorporate data and control flow.\\n2. **Variables**: Support for variables that can store and manipulate information during the execution of an application.\\n3. **Integration**: Seamless integration with language models, enabling dynamic responses based on evaluated expressions.\\n\\nLECL can be particularly useful in applications that require more sophisticated logic and data manipulation alongside the use of language models, such as chatbots, automated content generation, and decision-making systems.\\n\\nOverall, LECL enhances the capabilities of LangChain by providing a flexible and powerful way to create interactive and intelligent applications that leverage language models.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 252, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 279}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_48196bc67a', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-7055e42b-899a-4ed0-9861-96bc35b38d27-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 252, 'total_tokens': 279}\n"
