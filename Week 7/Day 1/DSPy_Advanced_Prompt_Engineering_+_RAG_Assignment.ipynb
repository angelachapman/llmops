        "<font color=\"blue\">Yes, since evaluation metrics can be defined in custom functions, DSPy absolutely lends itself to less exactly defined metrics. The main requirements for the evaluate function are its inputs (example, prediction, trace) and outputs (a float or int). In between, we can do whatever we want, including calling an llm to evaluate some more nuanced or vague aspect of the output (as one example, imagine evaluating \"human readability\" or a metric like \"helpfulness\"). As long as the output of our eval can be translated to a numeric value, DSPy lends itself to a very wide range of sophisticated evaluation techniques. The only risk to defining such vague metrics, as with all LLM-based evaluations, is the risk of introducing the LLM's biases and limitations into the evaluation process."
