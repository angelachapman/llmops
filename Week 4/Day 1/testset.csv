0,How do forward-looking statements in the Form 10-Q relate to the Company's results of operations?,"['Item 2. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within \nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking \nstatements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does \nnot directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. \nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” \n“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not \nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the \nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of \nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\n•\niPad Air®;\n•\niPad Pro®;\n•\niOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be \navailable on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and \niPadOS 18.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and \ncould in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.']","Forward-looking statements in the Form 10-Q provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and do not directly relate to any historical or current fact.

13,How do new product launches affect Apple's sales and expenses with seasonal demand and inventory adjustments?,"['Item 2. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within \nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking \nstatements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does \nnot directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. \nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” \n“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not \nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the \nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of \nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\n•\niPad Air®;\n•\niPad Pro®;\n•\niOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be \navailable on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices.
